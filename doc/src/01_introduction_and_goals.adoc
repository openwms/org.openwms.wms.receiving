== Introduction and Goals

The Receiving service is responsible to handle incoming orders, so called receiving orders, aka expected receipts or receiving notices.
Before a pallet or box enters a warehouse it must be announced beforehand. The box must be registered in the system with an identifier and
some other characteristics that may differ between projects.

This documentation outlines the scope, boundaries and constraints of the service, scratches the surface of the solution design and
documents significant aspects of the service.
